My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. I made this project as part of the Web Design Workshop (WDW) assignment for B.Tech 1st Year – CSE (AI & ML) at KIET Ghaziabad.

The main purpose of this website is to introduce myself, showcase my skills, highlight a few basic projects, and provide my contact details. The entire website is designed by me using simple, clean, and easy-to-read HTML and CSS.
